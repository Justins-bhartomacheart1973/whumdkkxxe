Just got out. Wow. The Life List is still spinning round in my head like socks in a dryer. Sat on a rusty bench outside the theater — at least I think it's rusty, feels liuke it. Theater was too noisy, someone kept rustling, popcorn crunchin' like my knees, back's hurting.

Can’t remember when I last saw a   where everything felt so... tangible yet ephemeral. It's like eating soup with a fork, man. Every scene dripped, no, oozed with this chaotic gracefulness. Like a cat trying to ballet dance on a waxed floor. This one scene where Eva, with that red umbrella, just stood in the rain for eternity (while her life list blew away like dandelion puffs), all while I’m here trying to find my seat under the communal popcorn shower.

> The way Jake and Tom argued over that old map was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 two squirrels fight over an acorn while a third one steals their stash. Almost too real, reminded me of that time at camp when Bobby and I got lost looking for the cabin. Was half-expecting them to start doing the Macarena or something.

> There was that part - oh God, what was it?... Where the music swelled like an ocean of marshmallows? No, it was more... more like jazz played by ducks in the middle of an autumn fog.

I think I heard the back of my neck 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 during the opening credits. That sound was definitely not in stereo. But when the credits started rolling, everyone clapped like it was a concert — didn’t get up for like 5 minutes, too busy digesting everything. Think I’m still digesting. Think I forgot my jacket.
